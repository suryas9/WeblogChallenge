This activity requires Python 3.5.3 and the following libraries:

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You also need software to run and execute notebook
[Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Execute

In the command prompt, go to the folder where jupyter notebook project file is copied and run the following command:

jupyter notebook paytm_weblog.ipynb

This will open the project file in your browser. Make sure to execute the cells from top to bottom only, as some variables are overwritten for better memory management, so executing cells in reverse could give incorrect results.

## Data file and folder

Create a folder with name unzip under the folder where you are executing the jupyter notebook file. Then copy the data file into the unzip folder.
